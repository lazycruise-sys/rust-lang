# Learning Rust

This repo is dedicated to learning the system language, Rust, and all the features on an in-depth level. Different .rs files would focus on learning to scale a particular feature of Rust.

## Features Learned
* Printing
* Variables
* Data Types
* Strings
* Tuples
* Array
* Vectors
* Loops
* Pointers
* Enum
* Functions
* CLI

## Learning Goals
* Write a code that calculates the Modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the Euclidean Algorithm.
* Build a CLI tool - currently building a Math Command Line tool

### Euclidean Algorithm
- [] Complete [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/rust/).
- [] Read Up [Rust Docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/index.html).
- [] Read [Modular multiplicative inverse of a number](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_multiplicative_inverse).
- [] Code the Algorithm

### Math Command Line Tool
This CLI tool makes use of cargo run to execute different mathematical operations (simple ones for now). Such as add, substract, multiply.
Currently, working on the divide command

An Example 'add' command is below;

```shell
cargo run add 1 2 3 4 5
```

Outputs:
```

## Tracking Progress
I will be writing articles that detail the different Rust learnings at my [Medium](https://lazycruise.medium.com).
