# Learning Rust

This repo is dedicated to learning the system language, Rust, and all the features on an in-depth level. Different .rs files would focus on learning to scale a particular feature of Rust.

## Features Learned
* Printing
* Variables
* Data Types

## Learning Goals
* Write a code that calculates the Modular multiplicative inverse of a number using the Euclidean Algorithm.
* Build a CLI tool (for what? don't know yet)

## Tracking Progress
I will be writing articles that detail the different Rust learnings at my [Medium](https://lazycruise.medium.com).
